# Simple-Python-Functions

This is a simple storage place for a bunch of python functions that are not nativly available.

finder.py: A more comprehenive use of the string find method to help you look for information and strip what is needed. 

modulemaker.py: This save you the effort of adding the required lines to make a module.s


Free for all to use. Please leave feedback if needed. I aim to update this every month or so with extra modules, functions and fixes
